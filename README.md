# Virtual-Mouse
It is a computer vision automation  project developed by me. Here I have used the python libraries like opencv, media pipe, autopy ,pyautogui to develop the entire project. Anyone can use this virtual mouse to automate the mouse pointer with own hand gestures. They don't need any external mouse anymore to operate mouse pointer
